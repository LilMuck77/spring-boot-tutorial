<p>
    After staining, always top coat with a clear protective finish.
    It will protect the wood against water, household chemicals, food stains and everyday wear. Tip: To minimize brush marks and bubbles,
    "tip off" each section of your project before the finish dries.
    Hold the brush at a 45-degree angle and lightly run the bristles over the entire length of wood.
