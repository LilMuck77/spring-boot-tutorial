<p>
    Choosing a wood stain is a matter of personal preference and do-it-yourselfers have a variety of stains to choose from.
    Stains such as Minwax® Wood Finish™ feature traditional wood tones,
    while Water-Based Stains (which includes 50 custom colors) allow you to select a stain color that coordinates with your decor.
    Tip: Before staining, always test the selected stain on a hidden area of your piece, or on scrap wood that matches the wood species of your project.
