<p>
    Make sure the wood is ready to stain by first sanding it lightly in the direction of the grain with a medium grit sandpaper,
    followed by one with a fine grit.
    Tip: If the wood is soft or porous, then after sanding, use a pre-stain wood conditioner to prevent blotching.
    If you are using a water-based stain, be sure to use a pre-stain wood conditioner, regardless of wood species.
